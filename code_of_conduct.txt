Group 2 â€“ Code of Conduct

All members of the group should:
-	Work within the code of conduct associated with the University
-	Work within the law
-	Contribute to the project to the best of their ability
-	Help others where it is possible
-	Turn up to meeting on time and prepared where possible (of course exceptional circumstances can be taken into account)
-	Be respectful to other members of the group and refrain from using language, or behaving in such a way, that is intended to offend other members
-	Recognise that all members are equal

Issues regarding misconduct will be dealt with internally as a group as much as possible, however if the issue continues then the issue will be dealt with externally.
